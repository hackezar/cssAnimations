    <p class="header1">Making text slide across the browser window</p>
    <p class="text">The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="textSlide">
    <h1 id="watchme">Watch me move</h1>
    <p>
    This example shows how to use CSS animations to make <code>H1</code>
    elements move across the page.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition, we output some text each time an animation event fires, so you
    can see them in action.
    </p>
    <ul id="output"></ul>
  </div>

  <div class="display">
    <p>
        Click anywhere on the screen or press any key to toggle the
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> between hidden and showing.
      </p>
      
      <div id="divElem">
        This is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that animates between
        <code>display: none; opacity: 0</code> and
        <code>display: block; opacity: 1</code>. Neat, huh?
      </div>
      
      <p>
        This is another paragraph to show that <code>display: none; </code> is being
        applied and removed on the above <code>&lt;div&gt; </code>. If only its
        <code>opacity</code> was being changed, it would always take up the space in
        the DOM.
